ICON INSTRUCTIONS

For a complete extension, you'll need to create the following PNG icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can generate these icons by:

1. Opening the icon.svg file in a tool like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or an online SVG editor
2. Exporting to the appropriate size PNG files
3. Placing the files in this directory

Alternatively, you can open the create_icons.html file in a web browser, and right-click on each canvas to save the icons directly as PNG files.

For a quick solution, you can also find free icon generators online or use a simple square with "RYM" text.
